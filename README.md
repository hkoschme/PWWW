# PWWW

In the Spring of 2016, I challenged myself to learn HTML and CSS while taking the class Publishing on the World Wide Web. We created mini-sites every week to master new skills. These new skills culminated in a mid-semester site, which I built from scratch using only a text editor, and a final site, where I used Dreamweaver as a tool to build another site afresh. After taking this class, I feel comfortable using plain text editors or software to edit and create websites.
