<h5>Does lower windspeed lead to a larger number of hourly users?</h5></a>
</div>

<div class="shortworkreport">In this report, I hypothesize that a lower windspeed corresponds to more bike users per hour. Using extensive analysis, I discovered that there is an acceptable simple linear relationship between the windspeed and the number of bikes rented out at that hour. Yet, it does not accord with my hypothesis. </div>

<h5>An Analysis of Sharing in Social Media: What do we choose to share?</h5></a></div>
<div class="shortworkreport">In this report, I took several factors of articles that were shared on social media, &nbsp;and hypothesized that shorter articles with more links, negativity, and images would be shared more. I concluded that negativity is the most important factor. </div>
